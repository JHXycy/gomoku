This is a java base coding project 
The requirement to win thisgame is that you have to connect 5 cheeses in a row either incline , horizontal or vertical.
This game can either be played by yourself. Or play with two people. In this game if you accidentally misclick the chessboard, it also has a Step back button, so that you can dismiss the previous step for it. In order to start the game, you will have to click “start” and then choose either “against computer” or “Two person”. This game might still have some bugs. It will keep improving.
Thank you for watching the description for how to play the game, and have fun with it
